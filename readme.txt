== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How does the submission limit work? =
You define the limit by editing a subscription level and defining the allowed number of submissions. The limits apply to each subscription period. If a vendor has a recurring subscription, that vendor's limit is reset to 0 when the next subscription payment is made, allowing the vendor to submit additional products for the current subscription period.

= Can I define a fixed submission limit that does not reset when a subscription renews? =
Not at this time. If you'd like this feature, let us know.
